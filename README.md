# ric-rac-roe
A simple tic-tac-toe game written in rust using the [piston](https://www.piston.rs/) game engine.

You play against an AI that is using the minimax algorithm to never let you win :)

The code is messy (my first proper rust project), the game lacks features and the algorithm is stupid yet.
